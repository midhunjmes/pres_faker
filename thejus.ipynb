        "\n",
        "    The expense report data was analyzed to calculate the average Seat Costs for all accounts in the cluster. Here's a breakdown of the findings:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. **Distribution of Seat Costs**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The average Seat Costs vary significantly across accounts, with a range of $367.19 between the highest and lowest.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - 5 out of 13 accounts (38.5%) have above-average Seat Costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - 8 out of 13 accounts (61.5%) have below-average Seat Costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **Cost Tiers**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - High Cost Tier (>$300): Account_002, Account_007\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Medium Cost Tier ($150-$300): Account_001, Account_003, Account_004\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Low Cost Tier (<$150): The remaining 8 accounts\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. **Statistical Analysis**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Median Seat Cost: $114.22 (Account_011)\n",
        "\n",
        "    - The overall average ($156.39) is higher than the median, suggesting some high-cost outliers are pulling the average up.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. **Data Reliability**:\n",

        "    - All 13 accounts have complete data for Seat Costs, with no NaN values reported.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - This suggests high data quality and reliability for this particular metric.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "    📌 **Next Steps**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Investigate the factors contributing to the high Seat Costs in Account_002 and Account_007.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Analyze the cost-efficiency measures implemented by lower-cost accounts (e.g., Account_013) for potential best practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Consider segmenting accounts into cost tiers for targeted cost management strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
